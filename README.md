# ClustVis
The new software package for visualization of atomic clusters and molecules 

is designed. Instead of analogous software products, this one compiled as a 

dynamic link library. It allows easy integration with any modelling program and 

“on-fly” visualization of calculated results. The software provides static and 

dynamic clusters and molecules visualization in atom-bond notation. Carried out 

tests prove the ability of new package to visualize a wide range of atomic clusters 

and nanostructures, included large biological macromolecules.
